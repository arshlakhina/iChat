# iChat

The objective of this iChat is to create a real time messaging/chatting website. In international market , there are various chatting apps such as whatsapp, telegram etc.. so I tried one based on same idea name as ‘iCHAT’.

Working:

Communication over internet is the main objective of chatting/messaging. And in this project we have used socket.io which is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event based communication between a client and a server. It has a server and a client and both of them are implemented in javascript (NodeJs)  and we add event listenters to see if the user has entered the chat, left the chat or had sended the message.
